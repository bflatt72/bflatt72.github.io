  <p>I’m not sure if this is entirely normal, but I actually spent several hours last night looking for the perfect theme for my blog. I then reviewed how to change my theme and did so by forking and cloning it to a local repo and then copying and pasting my old posts over, changing the data in the _config.yml file, pushing it back up to my repo and deleting the old one locally. I didn’t really like the theme I was using anymore because of several reasons. It was very limited and didn’t include Disqus comments or Google Analytics although I’m sure I could have figured out how to add it on my own. Also, I found some styling bugs in mobile and just didn’t like the looks of the theme overall. I wanted something minimal, but with a bit larger and eye popping font. I think I achieved all of that with the Beautiful-Jekyll theme.</p>

<p>I also added my <a href="http://www.freecodecamp">Free Code Camp</a> Portfolio project as another page to the blog. I found that in order to do this and bypass the template engine in order to use your own HTML/CSS and not cause conflicts all you have to do is not add the YAML header at the beginning of the HTML file. I then added another button to the portfolio page that links back to the blog and the Flatt Dev logo on the portfolio page links back to the blog. I wanted the portfolio to retain all my original code and not include any of the template layout so as to showcase my own coding skills.</p>

<p>100daysofcode is going great so far, today was day 20. I have as mentioned, completed the FCC portfolio project and am moving on now to learning JavaScript. I downloaded the first book of You Don’t Know Javascript to my Kindle and have read the first chapter so far. I am also going to start a small project I saw on Traversy Media, where he showed how to make a bookmark app that saves bookmarks to local storage, using Vanilla JavaScript.</p>

<p>I also learned how to embed a youtube video into Markdown. And damn, it worked on the first try. That NEVER happens. haha. Here is how you do it, via Google and this website <a href="http://www.adamwadeharris.com/how-to-easily-embed-youtube-videos-in-jekyll-sites-without-a-plugin/">Adam Wade Harris</a></p>

<p>Sometimes, this stuff really is like magic. Other times, things don’t work and I’m left staring at the code with arms folded, cursing “#(#<em>A))</em>) why isn’t this <em>#))(**(</em>&amp;### working??!!!!!!!!” and after I look at it awhile, and Google, I’m like, “Oh, my bad! I made a mistake. I see what I did. haha Sorry about that bro!” I talk to myself like that! haha Sometimes it’s as simple as missing a semicolon. Other times, it’s as simple as adding a class of img-fluid. Other times I have to really dig into it and figure out what it is I’m not understanding. It’s frustrating as hell, but when it works? Oh man, I feel like the smartest man alive!! haha</p>
